#What is File Descriptor?
In UNIX/Linux/macOS, every opened file (including devices, sockets, pipes) is represented by a file descriptor (FD) â†’ a small non-negative integer.
It acts like an index into the kernelâ€™s per-process table of open files.

0 -> stdin
1 -> stdout
2 -> stderr

Whenever we create a file the lowest unused fd is assigend to that file.
